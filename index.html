                        <p>
                            I want to learn web development from 2019 but somehow not everything was possible. I used to think about all these things
                            I have to pay, so I will do the course without knowing whether it will be fulfilled.

                    <p>
                        I'm trying to run the course as much as possible, I live in a shop in the market to run the family, I work from 8 to
                        1:30 at night.

                        The goal was to become an engineer one day, the dream did not come true, then I saw that there was no job in the
                        country, finally I thought about 2019, what can be done, then I will think after seeing your course. Finally I am giving
                        5 hours to enroll, I wish one day if I become a web developer, then I know I can do something to make a good person look
                        good.

                    <p> There was a lot of time when I was studying in college, it would have been very easy to do the course. I didn't
                    understand then. When I realized that there is no time but there is money. Still trying.</p>
